good editor for Java and python 

Pycharm remote deployment

Options for working on a remote system/source base

svn
deployment over sftp or similar
can synchronise code and control how code pushed/pulled

Follow link for remote server configuration:
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/webhelp/creating-a-remote-server-configuration.html

Set up remote server (Atlas) with normal Linux credentials
this is within the deployment setting section
setup remote interpreter, copying the deployment settings
this is within python interpreters and targets the required virtual environment you will be using
probably best using static one


temporary directory set up for synchronising with charm:
 >> ~/charm/

mapping setup between local project directory and remote deployment directory

svn check out into local project from repository, interpreter and remote deployment directory mapped to development system
edit and debug locally using remote interpreters, running web server on remote development system
commit changes directly from local system back to repository
local changes synchronised with remote deployment directory

Problem when running WebServer with duplicated home directory path, so remember to set d
ango deployment chroot and then mapping directories relative to this. e.g. root path = ~tan, mappings>remote directory = /charms

New project to manage new branch checkout just vims directory first
then enabled version control on project (simply press okay, so should already have URL)
so that you can update and commit from the vcs toolbar option

Don't forget to deploy updated files before running tests

Ensure mapped directories are what you think they are, including remote root directory

update interpreter location before next run. django-test-env is edited by run test script
