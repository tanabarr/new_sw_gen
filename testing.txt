-Unit testing

python module unit testing can be used in conjunction with pexpect module to test output of command line tools

testing a customised shell:
each time test, provide initial shell prompt
test itself must then open database (select database system, authenticate andselect the specific database)

due to the overheads of setup and teardown , test significant functionality by selecting a large sample from the database. (Will produce a large dictionary)

For non-printable data types,save files to the file system and compare from there
