Code review steps

Development merge does not need doing unless seen as necessary

Create diff between current and origin of branch

Get on to the review board site, new request for a few, selected directory where difference made, browse to select the diff file, creates review request, fill out description and list of reviewersAnd then submit.

If development merge already done and committed, just revert local version to origin and compare with most current version.

Post-review is a good command line tool to do this.

Fixed by making changes related to the comment or drop comment
