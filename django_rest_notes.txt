Typical focus on serialisation and deserialisation between Python datatypes and JSON, less focus on templates and actual   HTML (much more done under the hood).

use of models, url routers, custom serialisers

serialisation functions taking the object to be serialized and returning a serialisation object, deserialisation done by calling the serialiser with a "data=" parameter. detection of whether to deserialise is done under the hood?

modelserialiser subclass reduces the replication of code in the desired model.

similar idea with view sets
