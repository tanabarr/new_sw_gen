Trying to install boardcom Windows drivers for usb Bluetooth dongle and Bluetooth headset.

Software installer Failing, make sure generic Bluetooth adapter is enabled in device manager.

Only have dongle plug-in, turnoff other Bluetooth devices.
 
enable compatibility mode for XP on the setup executable and run as administrator(can't run from network drive).
 	
setup is very slow but should complete s	uccessfully.
