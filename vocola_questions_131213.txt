Vocola/unimacro queries
I've got a couple of questions hopefully someone can answer below.

Focusing applications
is it true that when an application is in memory the grammars for it are active, not just when the application window is in focus.
Anyway of modifying this behaviour so that grammars for a particular application are any active when one of the application windows is"top" or in focus?

Unimacro folders
using the folders grammar, when I specify a shared drive in a folder path, which I use as an off-line folder, and I'm not connected to the network this comes up as an obsolete folder/drive. The files are still available from"my computer" as they have been stored off-line.
Any possible workarounds for this?
I have previously asked about the"^X" character appearing when using the brackets grammar in unix, possible workarounds have been suggested and will be tested soon. So thanks for that.


I've also been working on my vim vocola set up and have produced an .vch header file available at https://github.com/whIzz2000/vocola/blob/master/vim.vch
I'm using this with mintty/gvim/putty executables.
none of it is my original work, just borrowed from vocola samples/vim tips website and a "gist" vocola script someone posted on (public) github.

Hope it helps someone.
