Django environment set up for 1.6 & 1.5
site runs fine for 1.5 
(move apps directory changes to 6640 branch (avoiding any .svn dirs; cp -r <b#6639:/apps/domains> <b#6640:/apps/> domains, also copy the following: warrants/models.py tasks/models.py), backup then remove apps directory on branch 6639 then run sub update, alternatively if in rush: cd project_source; tar -cf ~/bkvims.tar vims; rm -rf vims; sub up)

some updates to Django 1.6 compatible packages not possible because of old distribute/setuptools/pip versions
with new version problem with adding a task
don't want to have to go through GUI\ to run the tests manually...

cannot run rest tests for reggression testing purposes

Strange behaviour when adding a task? Symptom seems to have appeared since moving to Django 1.6
output from WebServer: POST /tasks/api/create/ HTTP/1.1" 400 173

----
update required due to optimisations  in database interaction

Django update:
new requirements.txt, 
create a new environment with --copy-all to make it self-contained.
install from requirements file, old package versions
pip install --upgrade <package_names>
new package is should then be contained within .pip dir
can then transfer env folder to different system
edit wiki with Django update page
