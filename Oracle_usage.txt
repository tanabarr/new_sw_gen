Following Oracle technetwork tutorial on demonstration of Oraclevm3 server and manager using virtual box.

Involves setting up two host only network to demonstrate on a single physical host.
In this case it is subnet 192.168.56.0/24 & 192.168.209.0/24

Oracleserver1:192.168.56.101
Oracleserver2:192.168.56.102

Manager vm root password:test+
Oraclemanager1:192.168.56.100

Aut/als40caflahad enough ,\comma because thatdr30aaembetNoserver vm root password:ovsroot

domain names same as machine names appended by example.com

Apart from manager which is manager.example.com

manager has GUI

Manager has attached virtual disks:
pool1-poolfs 12gb
pool1-repository1 12gb
template-library 12gb

fdisk each of the device entries (fdisk /dev/sdc for example)
format the partitions:
mke2fs -j -L pool1poolfs /dev/sdc1

summary procedure:
create virtual disks
partition and format virtual disks within virtual OS
cream mount points and entries for automatic filesystem mount
mount filesystems 
setup mounted filesystems as export by nfs (entries in export file)
***start port mapper to allocate dynamic port for service 
start NFS and configure for autostart

/*****************************************//*****************************************/
this creates the server pool and manager, virtual machines of Linux databased hosts can then be hosted within the server pool, managed and created by the manager. These hosted virtual machines run the databases (one per managed virtual guest)
prebuilt manager appliance has the HTTP server already enabled which just need configuring, manager will then host any VM's or other images required for server pool resources. These are then imported using HTTP or FTP.

Oracle VM manager has to be started, /etc/init.d/ovmm start
xmanager can then be run from 192.168.56.100/ovm/console

Console only available over HTTPS using port 7002
manager can then be run from https://192.168.56.100:7002/ovm/console


Oracle VM manager has different credentials, not root or Oracle (for VM login and VM template).
user:admin
password:Welcome1

'Alternative addresses includeloop back port eight eight eight eight,/OvS

Once logged in as administrator into VM manager, Discover servers using VM agent (password:ovsroot any other password causes problems) on the relevant IP range.

When discovering storage, specify manager IP address, call fileserver: ManagerFileServer, specify both servers to administer and mount the filesystem.
Catalogue both poolfs and repofs1

virtual network for 192.168.56.0/24 is already discovered as main network, add another environment for the virtual machine servers. & eth1 from each of the servers to the network. Don't worry about addressing (leave as none)

Create a server pool:
Pool1
192.168.56.200
needs to be at least twelve gig

Best to release and then remove virtual hard drive using virtual media manager (access via file menu in the virtual box manager)
then can remove the file in directory and then recreate in the virtual box manager.
