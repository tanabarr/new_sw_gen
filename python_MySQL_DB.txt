import MySQLdb as mdb

For this to work need to install python-mysqldb (for client application)
and mysql-server (for server database)

Import MySQLdb.cursors

Required to use dictionary type cursor

"shelve" module used for serialisation and database transfers

Example command:

  cursor.execute("DELETE FROM Writers WHERE Id = 5")  
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM Writers WHERE Id = 4") 
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM Writer WHERE Id = 3") 
    
    conn.commit()

except mdb.Error, e:
  
    conn.rollback()
    print "Error %d: %s" % (e.args[0],e.args[1])
