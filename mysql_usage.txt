mysql -u root -p test

> select * from mysql.user;
> create database <database name>;
> show databases;
> use <database name>;
> SHOW TABLES;
> DESCRIBE <table name>;
> CREATE TABLE <new table name> LIKE <old table name>;
> INSERT <new table name> * FROM <old table name>; 
> ALTER [ONLINE | OFFLINE] [IGNORE] TABLE tbl_name

alter_specification:
    table_options
  | ADD [COLUMN] col_name column_definition
        [FIRST | AFTER col_name ]
  | ADD [COLUMN] (col_name)

Install server on Ubuntu (MySQL-server)
set password for root user
mysql -h localhost -u root -p
...

> CREATE DATABASE testdb; 
mysql> use testdb
Database changed
mysql> CREATE USER 'testuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'test123';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL ON testdb.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 (0.00 sec)

to select from table:
> SELECT *<or column name> FROM <table name> WHERE <column name> = "string"

Use fetchall () to refer the data via, names of the columns e.g. row["component_name"]

To update an object:
> UPDATE table SET ... (multiple changes listed with, separators) ... WHERE ...

In order to delete an entry (python implementation):
>  cursor.execute("DELETE FROM Writers WHERE Id = 5")  
    
  

Remote access:

Access through port 3306, ensure this is forwarded/accessible (could Ssh to tunnel
need to grant access to tables for specific users
e.g., from remote system x and user y with identification phrase z:
> CREATE USER 'y'@'x' IDENTIFIED BY 'z'
> GRANT ALL ON <database name>.* TO 'y'@'x';

Don't forget to set password for remote users as well as local.


The user and account details contained in MySQL.user

Need to specify interface on which to listen for SQL Server
bind-address change from local host 
/etc/mysql/my.cnf
(bind_address 192.168...)

If on a local network, hostname may be required to have.local appended e.g. Bob.local

Will then have to set specific password for user at this hostname

Use IP address of host in the connect () call and don't forget to grant access to require table.

Create table requires table definition:
specify column for ID (unique), names (varchar) and address (varchar).

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS address_list (id INT(32) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE',
names VARCHAR(512), address VARCHAR(512))


Initial connection:
root user loggin initially and then change password:
mysql>SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('secret_password')

Check there are not scripts that interfere with this process, it may be already set up in a custom manner.
For example, Red Hat has a default user: mysql with no password but also no privileges.
You are able to see a very minimal amount with mysql user. You would not be able to see tables or user information related to other users e.g. root.

Can execute MySQL commands will from command line (and shell script) using mysql -u user -ppassword -e <command>


look at lamp_setup for some troubleshooting steps with initial connection.


"Help <SQL command>"is useful, can find commands from a reference 
command is: 
  BACKUP TABLE bkupreq TO '/home/tan/backup';
  
to restore:
  RESTORE TABLE Requests FROM '/home/tan/backup';

CYGWIN
/*-------------------------------------------- */

mysql-python is the new name for MySQLdb
installed on cygwin through easy_install
When trying to run the server daemon, errors appear relating to trying to access/create the plug-in directory.suggested to run the upgrade script (MySQL_upgrade).
Instead run the MySQL_install_db
execute mysqld
